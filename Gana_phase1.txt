Dataset ideas:

Github repository: https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/nfg23/info2950-final-project

Idea 1:  Sorority recruitment by statistics by the breakdown of race/grade/nationality 
Availability of the data: can be surveyed form girls at Cornell online, Cornell Panhellenic also has recruitment statistics that I can reach out to if I needed a bigger picture about what to survey. 

Idea 2: Cayugas's watcher's protocol uses at parties 
Since there were so many new Cayugas watchers due to the new greek life restrictions, I figured I would survey them and asses to what extreme they had to handle certain events and what types of events. might be a little bit more difficult because everyone is off-campus 
Idea 3: Cornell Students, majors, and internships for 2020
interviewing my Cornell peers about the internships they have (information about it) and if they got canceled amid COVID-19. Although I feel as though this data can be accessed easily I'm not sure how emotionally insensitive it is to survey people and make a data about this topic since I know a lot of my peers are not taking the news lightly
Idea 4: Use a dataset from Kaggle around the topic of diversity in tech because I get nervous asking people to fill out a survey.
