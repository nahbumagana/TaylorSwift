# INFO 2950 Final Project - Taylor Swift Sentiment Analysis 

Introduction - Taylor Swift Sentiment Analysis

Taylor swift has been a country and pop sensation in the past decade, from being a small town girl next door to a ten time grammay award winner. WIth that being said she has also had a very scandalous reputatiion among other celebrities that has effected the way her music has changed and the style in which she write her music. In this projetct I sought to see how her music has chnaged oveer the here by analyzing the sentiment of her music from positive to negative and the subjectivity of her music from whether it was really personal to her verses if it could be objectively interpreted. Furthermore, I used her pop counter part selena gomez, someone who hasn't been as peutable in the hollywood spotlight as a baseline for comparison throughout this project. I went in with the intital predictions that the data would show that selena's music was more objectively focused had a mroe positive sentiment to it.
