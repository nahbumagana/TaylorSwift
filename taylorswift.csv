2017,Why She Disappeared [Poem],"When she fell, she fell apart. Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends  When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices Echoes she heard even in her sleep: ""Whatever you say, it is not right."" ""Whatever you do, it is not enough."" ""Your kindness is fake."" ""Your pain is manipulative.""  When she lay there on the ground, She dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something, Not just the idea of something.  When she finally rose, she rose slowly Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies Wary of phone calls and promises, Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes  When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck Bathed in her brokenness Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed Standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something, not just the idea of something.  When she turned to go home, She heard the echoes of new words ""May your heart remain breakable But never by the same hand twice"" And even louder: ""without your past, you could never have arrived- so wondrously and brutally, By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance ...here.""  And in the death of her reputation, She felt truly alive."

2017,Reputation [Prologue],"Here's something I've learned about people.  We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.  This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.  The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.  When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?  Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...  We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.  There will be no further explanation. There will be just reputation."
2012,State of Grace," I'm walking fast through the traffic lights Busy streets and busy lives And all we know, is touch and go We are alone with our changing minds We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time   And I never saw you coming And I’ll never be the same   You come around and the armor falls Pierce the room like a cannon ball Now all we know, is don’t let go We are alone, just you and me Up in your room and our slates are clean Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes   So you were never a saint And I've loved in shades of wrong We learn to live with the pain Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild   And I never  saw you coming And I’ll never  be the same   This is a state of grace This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right These are the hands of fate You’re my Achilles heel This is the golden age of something good And right and real   And I never  saw you coming And I’ll never  be the same   And I never  saw you coming And I’ll never (So you were never a saint And I've loved in shades of wrong) Be the same (We learn to live with the pain Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild)   This is a state of grace This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right"
2017,If You’re Anything Like Me [Poem],"If you're anything like me, You bite your nails, And laugh when you're nervous. You promise people the world, because that's what they want from you. You like giving them what they want... But darling, you need to stop,  If you're anything like me, You knock on wood every time you make plans. You cross your fingers, hold your breath, Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck. Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado... If life gets too good now, Darling, it scares you.  If you're anything like me, You never wanted to lock your door, Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore For fear she was much better before... But Darling, now you have to.  If you're anything like me, There's a justice system in your head For names you'll never speak again, And you make your ruthless rulings. Each new enemy turns to steel They become the bars that confine you, In your own little golden prison cell... But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.  If you're anything like me You've grown to hate your pride To love your thighs And no amount of friends at 25 Will fill the empty seats At the lunch tables of your past The teams that picked you last... But Darling, you keep trying.  If you're anything like me, You couldn't recognize the face of your love Until they stripped you of your shiny paint Threw your victory flag away And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway... Darling, later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day.  If you're anything like me, I'm sorry.  But Darling, it's going to be okay."
2012,Red," Loving him is like driving a new Maserati Down a dead-end street Faster than the wind, passionate as sin Ending so suddenly Loving him is like trying to change your mind Once you're already flying through the free fall Like the colors in autumn, so bright Just before they lose it all   Losing him was blue like I'd never known Missing him was dark grey, all alone Forgetting him was like Trying to know somebody you never met But loving him was red Loving him was red   Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted Was right there in front of you Memorizing him was as easy as knowing All the words to your old favorite song Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword And realizing there's no right answer Regretting him was like wishing you never found out That love could be that strong   Losing him was blue like I'd never known Missing him was dark grey, all alone Forgetting him was like Trying to know somebody you never met But loving him was red Oh, red Burning red   Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go But moving on from him is impossible When I still see it all in my head In burning red Loving him was red   Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known Missing him was dark grey, all alone Forgetting him was like Trying to know somebody you never met 'Cause loving him was red Yeah, yeah, red We're burning red   And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head Comes back to me, burning red Yeah, yeah   His love was like driving a new Maserati Down a dead-end street"
2010,Dear John," Long were the nights when My days once revolved around you Counting my footsteps Praying the floor won't fall through... again My mother accused me of losing my mind But I swore I was fine You paint me a blue sky Then go back and turn it to rain And I lived in your chess game But you changed the rules everyday Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why   Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I shoulda' known   Well maybe it's me And my blind optimism to blame Or maybe it's you and your sick need To give love and take it away And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors Who don't understand And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said ""Run as fast as you can""   Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong Don't you think nineteen's too young To be played by your dark, twisted games When I loved you so? I shoulda' known   You are an expert at sorry And keeping the lines blurry Never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes 'Cause you burned them out But I took your matches Before fire could catch me So don't look now I'm shining like fireworks Over your sad empty town, yeah Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh   Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home   I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

2010,Enchanted," There I was again tonight Forcing laughter, faking smiles Same old tired, lonely place Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy Vanished when I saw your face All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you   Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?"" Across the room your silhouette Starts to make its way to me The playful conversation starts Counter all your quick remarks Like passing notes in secrecy And it was enchanting to meet you All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you   This night is sparkling Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck Blushing all the way home I'll spend forever Wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you   The lingering question kept me up 2AM, who do you love?

2010,Last Kiss," I still remember the look on your face Lit through the darkness at 1:58 The words that you whispered For just us to know You told me you loved me So why did you go away? Away  I do recall now the smell of the rain Fresh on the pavement I ran off the plane That July 9th The beat of your heart It jumps through your shirt I can still feel your arms   But now I'll go sit on the floor Wearing your clothes All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss I never thought we'd have a last kiss Never imagined we'd end like this Your name, forever the name on my lips   I do remember the swing of your step The life of the party, you're showing off again And I roll my eyes and then You pull me in I'm not much for dancing But for you I did  Because I love your handshake, meeting my father I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions   And I'll go sit on the floor Wearing your clothes All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss I never thought we'd have a last kiss I never imagined we'd end like this Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh   So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are Hope it's nice where you are  And I hope the sun shines And it's a beautiful day And something reminds you You wish you had stayed You can plan for a change in weather and time But I never planned on you changing your mind   So I'll go sit on the floor Wearing your clothes All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss I never thought we'd have a last kiss Never imagined we'd end like this Your name, forever the name on my lips  Just like our last kiss Forever the name on my lips Forever the name on my lips   Just like our last"
2012,Begin Again," Took a deep breath in the mirror He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do Turn the lock and put my headphones on He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do Walked in, expecting you'd be late But you got here early and you stand and wave I walk to you You pull my chair out and help me in And you don't know how nice that is, but I do   And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did I've been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again   You said you never met one girl who Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do We tell stories and you don't know why I'm coming off a little shy, but I do   But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did I've been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again   And we walked down the block to my car And I almost brought him up But you start to talk About the movies that your family watches Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that And for the first time, what's past is past   'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did I've been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again   But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again"
2019,Beautiful Ghosts," Follow me home if you dare to I wouldn't know where to lead you Should I take chances when no one took chances on me? So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start With no beauty in my memory   All that I wanted was to be wanted Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted Born into nothing At least you have something, something to cling to Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into And the memories were lost long ago But at least you have beautiful ghosts   Perilous night, their voices calling A flicker of light before the dawning Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me Scared to call them my friends and be broken again Is this hope just a mystical dream?   All that I wanted was to be wanted Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted Born into nothing At least you have something, something to cling to Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into And the memories were lost long ago But at least you have beautiful ghosts   And so maybe my home isn't what I had known What I thought it would be But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free   All that I wanted was to be wanted I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted Born into nothing With them, I have something, something to cling to I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into And the memories were lost long ago So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts And the memories were lost long ago So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts"
2010,Mine," You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables Left a small town and never looked back I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts   I say, ""Can you believe it?"" As we're lying on the couch The moment, I could see it Yes, yes, I can see it now   Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine   Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes   But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes, yes This is what I thought about:   Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine   And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye 'Cause that's all I've ever known Then, you took me by surprise You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""   You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water And every time I look at you, it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine"" Hold on, make it last Hold on, never turn back You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine   Yeah, yeah Do you believe it?  We're gonna make it now  And I can see it Yeah, yeah I can see it now "
2010,Back to December," I'm so glad you made time to see me How's life? Tell me, how's your family? I haven't seen them in a while You've been good, busier than ever We small talk, work and the weather Your guard is up and I know why   Because the last time you saw me Is still burned in the back of your mind You gave me roses, and I left them there to die   So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night And I'd go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine   I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright I go back to December all the time   These days, I haven't been sleeping Staying up, playing back myself leaving When your birthday passed and I didn't call And I think about summer, all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side and Realized I loved you in the fall   And then the cold came The dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye   So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night And I'd go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine   I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time   I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile So good to me, so right And how you held me in your arms that September night The first time you ever saw me cry Maybe this is wishful thinking Probably mindless dreaming But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't So if the chain is on your door, I understand   But this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night And I'd go back to December It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine   I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time   All the time"
2019,Christmas Tree Farm," My winter nights are taken up by static Stress and holiday shopping traffic But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else Just like magic   In my heart is a Christmas tree farm Where the people would come To dance under sparkling lights Bundled up in their mittens and coats And the cider would flow And I just wanna be there tonight   Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon Mistakes are forgiven And everythin' is icy and blue And you would be there too   Under the mistletoe Watchin' the fire glow And tellin' me, ""I love you"" Just bein' in your arms Takes me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true   In my heart is a Christmas tree farm There's a light in the barn We run inside out from the cold In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs And they're warm and they're safe They wake to see a blanket of snow   Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon Mistakes are forgiven And everythin' is icy and blue And you would be there too   Under the mistletoe Watchin' the fire glow And tellin' me, ""I love you"" Just bein' in your arms Takes me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true Baby, yeah   And when I'm feelin' alone You remind me of home Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas And when the world isn't fair I pretend that we're there Baby, baby, Merry Christmas    Under the mistletoe  Watching the fire glow And tellin' me, ""I love you""   Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas  Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas I love you Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas  Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas Where every wish comes true I love you"
2012,Holy Ground," I was reminiscing just the other day While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme Took off faster than a green light, go Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made And that was the first day   And darling, it was good Never looking down And right there where we stood Was holy ground   Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress We had this big wide city all to ourselves We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you"" And for the first time, I had something to lose And I guess we fell apart in the usual way And the story's got dust on every page But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now And I see your face in every crowd   'Cause darling, it was good Never looking down And right there where we stood Was holy ground   Tonight, I'm gonna dance For all that we've been through But I don't wanna dance If I'm not dancing with you Tonight, I'm gonna dance Like you were in this room But I don't wanna dance If I'm not dancing with you   It was good Never looking down And right there where we stood Was holy ground   Tonight, I'm gonna dance For all that we've been through But I don't wanna dance If I'm not dancing with you Tonight, I'm gonna dance Like you were in this room But I don't wanna dance If I'm not dancing with you"
2012,Treacherous," Put your lips close to mine As long as they don't touch Out of focus, eye to eye 'Til the gravity's too much And I'll do anything you say If you say it with your hands And I'd be smart to walk away But you're quicksand   This slope is treacherous This path is reckless This slope is treacherous And I-I-I like it   I can't decide if it's a choice Getting swept away I hear the sound of my own voice Asking you to stay And all we are is skin and bone Trained to get along Forever going with the flow But you're friction   This slope is treacherous This path is reckless This slope is treacherous And I, I, I like it   Two headlights shine through the sleepless night And I will get you, get you alone Your name has echoed through my mind And I just think you should, think you should know That nothing safe is worth the drive And I will follow you, follow you home Follow you, follow you home   This hope is treacherous This daydream is dangerous This hope is treacherous I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I   Two headlights shine through the sleepless night And I will get you, get you alone Your name has echoed through my mind And I just think you should, think you should know That nothing safe is worth the drive And I will follow you, follow you home Follow you, follow you home I'll follow you, follow you home Follow you, follow you home   This slope is treacherous I-I-I like it"
2010,Mean," You, with your words like knives And swords and weapons that you use against me You have knocked me off my feet again Got me feeling like I'm nothing You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard Calling me out when I'm wounded You, picking on the weaker man   Well, you can take me down With just one single blow But you don't know what you don't know   Someday, I'll be living in a big old city And all you're ever gonna be is mean Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean?   You, with your switching sides And your wildfire lies and your humiliation You have pointed out my flaws again As if I don't already see them I walk with my head down, trying to block you out 'Cause I'll never impress you I just wanna feel okay again   I bet you got pushed around Somebody made you cold But the cycle ends right now 'Cause you can't lead me down that road And you don't know what you don't know   Someday, I'll be living in a big old city And all you're ever gonna be is mean Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean?   And I can see you years from now in a bar Talking over a football game With that same big loud opinion But nobody's listening Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing But all you are is mean All you are is mean And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean   But someday, I'll be living in a big old city And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah   Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean? Someday, I'll be living in a big old city  And all you're ever gonna be is mean  Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me  And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean?"
2010,Long Live," I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind The time we stood with our shaking hands The crowds in stands went wild We were the kings and the queens And they read off our names The night you danced like you knew our lives Would never be the same You held your head like a hero On a history book page It was the end of a decade But the start of an age   Long live the walls we crashed through All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming, long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders One day, we will be remembered   I said, remember this feeling I passed the pictures around Of all the years that we stood there On the side-lines wishing for right now We are the kings and the queens You traded your baseball cap for a crown When they gave us our trophies And we held them up for our town And the cynics were outraged Screaming, ""This is absurd"" 'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves In ripped up jeans got to rule the world   Long live the walls we crashed through All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming, long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid Long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you I was screaming, long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day, we will be remembered   Hold on to spinning around Confetti falls to the ground May these memories break our fall   Will you take a moment? Promise me this That you'll stand by me forever But if, God forbid, fate should step in And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day When they point to the pictures Please tell them my name Tell them how the crowds went wild Tell them how I hope they shine Long live the walls we crashed through I had the time of my life, with you   Long, long live the walls we crashed through All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming, long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid Singing, long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you And long, long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day, we will be remembered"

Drew walks by me Can't he tell that I can't breathe? And there he goes, so perfectly The kind of flawless I wish I could be   She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause   He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do...   So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight   He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do...   He's the time taken up, but there's never enough And he's all that I need to fall into Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see"
2012,The Moment I Knew," You should've been there Should've burst through the door With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile And it would've felt like A million little shining stars had just aligned And I would've been so happy   Christmas lights glisten I've got my eye on the door Just waiting for you to walk in But the time is ticking People ask me how I've been As I comb back through my memory How you said you'd be here You said you'd be here   And it was like slow motion Standing there in my party dress In red lipstick With no one to impress And they're all laughing As I'm looking around the room But there was one thing missing And that was the moment I knew   And the hours pass by Now I just wanna be alone But your close friends always seem to know When there's something really wrong So they follow me down the hall And there in the bathroom I try not to fall apart And the sinking feeling starts As I say hopelessly ""He said he'd be here""   And it was like slow motion Standing there in my party dress In red lipstick With no one to impress And they're all laughing And asking me about you But there was one thing missing  And that was the moment I knew   What do you say When tears are streaming down your face In front of everyone you know? And what do you do When the one who means the most to you Is the one who didn't show?   You should've been here And I would've been so happy   And it was like slow motion Standing there in my party dress In red lipstick With no one to impress And they're all standing around me, singing ""Happy birthday to you"" But there was one thing missing And that was the moment I knew Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh   You called me later And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"" And I said, ""I'm sorry, too"" And that was the moment I knew"

I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinking How we don't have a song"" And he says   Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window When we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"" And when I got home 'fore I said amen Asking God if he could play it again   I was walking up the front porch steps After everything that day Had gone all wrong and been trampled on And lost and thrown away Got to the hallway, well on my way To my lovin' bed I almost didn't notice all the roses And the note that said   Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window When we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"" And when I got home 'fore I said amen Asking God if he could play it again   I've heard every album, listened to the radio Waited for something to come along That was as good as our song   'Cause our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window When we're on the phone and he talks real slow 'Cause it's late and his mama don't know Our song is the way he laughs The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"" And when I got home 'fore I said amen Asking God if he could play it again Play it again   I was riding shotgun with my hair undone In the front seat of his car I grabbed a pen and an old napkin And I wrote down our song"

2010,The Story of Us," I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us How we met, and the sparks flew instantly And people would say, they're the lucky ones I used to know my place was a spot next to you Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat 'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on   Oh, a simple complication Miscommunications lead to fallout So many things that I wish you knew So many walls up, I can't break through   Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room And we're not speaking And I'm dying to know Is it killing you like it's killing me?

2012,Come Back... Be Here," You said it in a simple way 4AM, the second day How strange that I don't know you at all Stumbled through the long goodbye One last kiss, then catch your flight Right when I was just about to fall   I told myself, don't get attached But in my mind, I play it back Spinning faster than the plane that took you   And this is when the feeling sinks in I don't wanna miss you like this Come back, be here, come back, be here I guess you're in New York today I don't wanna need you this way Come back, be here, come back, be here   The delicate beginning rush The feeling you can know so much Without knowing anything at all And now that I can put this down If I had known what I know now I never would've played so nonchalant   Taxi cabs and busy streets That never bring you back to me I can't help but wish you took me with you   And this is when the feeling sinks in I don't wanna miss you like this Come back, be here, come back, be here I guess you're in London today And I don't wanna need you this way Come back, be here, come back, be here   This is falling in love in the cruelest way This is falling for you when you are worlds away In New York, be here But you're in London, and I break down 'Cause it's not fair that you're not around   This is when the feeling sinks in I don't wanna miss you like this Come back, be here, come back, be here I guess you're in New York today And I don't wanna need you this way Come back, be here, come back, be here   Oh-oh, oh-oh I don't wanna miss you like this Oh-oh, oh-oh Come back, be here Come back, be here"

2008,Forever & Always," Once upon a time I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye And we caught onto something I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me Were you just kidding? 'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down We almost never speak I don't feel welcome anymore Baby, what happened? Please tell me 'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door   And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all And you flashback to when he said forever and always Oh, and it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always   Was I out of line? Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide Like a scared little boy? I looked into your eyes Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure So here's to everything coming down to nothing Here's to silence that cuts me to the core Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore   And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all And you flashback to when he said forever and always Oh, and it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so   Oh, back up, baby, back up Did you forget everything? Back up, baby, back up Did you forget everything?   'Cause it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all And you flashback to when we said forever and always And  it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always You didn't mean it baby You said forever and always, yeah"
2010,Ours," Elevator buttons and morning air Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares But right now, my time is theirs Seems like there's always someone who disapproves They'll judge it like they know about me and you And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do The jury's out, but my choice is you   So don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard The stakes are high, the water's rough But this love is ours   You never know what people have up their sleeves Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine   And you'll say Don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard The stakes are high, the water's rough But this love is ours   And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith With this song for you   'Cause I love the gap between your teeth And I love the riddles that you speak And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos Will be ignored 'Cause my heart is yours   So don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard Don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine But they can't take what's ours They can't take what's ours   The stakes are high, the water's rough But this love is ours"
2012,I Knew You Were Trouble (Intro),"I think... I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes, you know? It's like a kaleidoscope of memories, it just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, it was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again, but I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him, it was losing me."
